	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>What should a bring to the spa?</dt>
		<dd>Be sure to read your tour description carefully. For the most part, what you need to bring depends upon the package and spa you will be attending. Some spas are full service, and supply all materials, either in room or at the spa itself. If you are not taking an overnight tour, be sure to check with the spa to make sure they have arrangements for storing valuables.</dd>
		<dt>Are massages performed... you know...</dt>
		<dd>Again, it depends upon the spa and your personal preference. Most spas cater to your personal preferences. If you wish to wear the robe only, feel free to do so. Professional massage therapists are trained to drape throughout the massage. It is also quite common for guests to wear under garments or bathing suits.</dd>
		<dt>Are the packages restricted, or can I use all areas of the spa?</dt>
		<dd>In negotiating our tours, we make sure guests have access to the entire spa, regardless of package. If you are not enjoying your spa experience, or would like to try something else, feel free. Please understand that additional charges may apply.</dd>
		<dt>What do I need to tell the spa?</dt>
		<dd>Based on your package, certain spa treatments might be restricted if you are pregnant, nursing, injured, or have specific allergies. Make sure you inform the spa well in advance of your appointment of any current conditions that might prevent you from partaking in your spa treatments. If concerns are caught early enough, the spa will make arrangements for an alternate activity.</dd>
