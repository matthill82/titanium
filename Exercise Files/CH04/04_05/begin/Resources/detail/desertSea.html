	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>Why is it not named "From the Desert  to the Sea?"</dt>
		<dd>We feel that the word "the" is used too much as it is.</dd>
		<dt>The Salton Sea is smelly</dt>
		<dd>Yes it is. However, we feel you should focus on the fact that you are in a very unique and pristine place. The salinity levels are off the charts, which results in huge amounts of fish-kills throughout the year. This, combined with the mineral slag that runs off the sea, contributes to a mighty aroma. We can tell you that on day two you don't notice it as much.</dd>
		<dt>Can my friends ride with us on the Mojave tour?</dt>
		<dd>No. We know the road is open and free to everyone, and we've had biker's attach themselves to the pack in the past. However, we would like to point out that all our stops along the way are pre-negotiated in price and number of people based on the tour reservations. If extra people show up, there will be not enough space. We can't keep your friends from riding along with you, but we can cancel your tour. Thankfully that has not had to happen as of yet, but we are understandably strict regarding this rule.</dd>
		<dt>Does the Joshua Tree tour feature the U2 tree?</dt>
		<dd>Yes! Although now dangerously close to dying from all the abuse it has taken from tourists and U2 fans, "the" Joshua Tree is part of our tour.</dd>
