	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>Are children welcome on the Endangered Species tour?</dt>
		<dd>Yes! Children 10 and over are welcome on this tour. However, some of the areas we travel to are very sensitive and others are very remote. Please keep a close eye on your child and make sure he or she understands the very strict policies we have around preserving those habitats. We feel that these tours are wonderful educational opportunities and that they are perfect for kids!</dd>
		<dt>Do we need hiking gear for these tours?</dt>
		<dd>It depends on the tours. For the Endangered Species and Fossil Tour, yes. For the Monterey Aquarium tour you just need a comfortable pair of shoes.</dd>
		<dt>Can I keep any fossils I find?</dt>
		<dd>It depends. Certain fossils (old shells, trilobites) are so common that they are of little use to the archeologists on site. However, each fossil must be analyzed and approved before it is allowed off site. No exceptions. </dd>
		<dt>Are the nature trips seasonal?</dt>
		<dd>California enjoys mild weather all year, and most of our tours are available no matter what the season. However, certain tours have restrictions based on rainy seasons or animal migration. Check with the individual tours for any date restrictions.</dd>
