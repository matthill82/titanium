<body>
	<p>Over and over again our customer support people would hear, "but what if we have kids?" when describing a tour. Then it hit us...why not create tours specifically for kids?! California is an amazing playground for everyone and should be experienced by all. From amazing museums, outstanding parks, Disney, and kid-centered nature experiences, Kids California truly has it all! </p>
	
	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>I don't see anything about scheduling a pick-up date for my child.</dt>
		<dd>That's because you're supposed to go with them. Our Kids California trips are not camps nor are they day-care. Spend some quality time with your kids and have fun, we promise you'll enjoy it.</dd>
		<dt>Are shuttles provided for the LA tour?</dt>
		<dd>Yes! However, it should be noted that shuttles leave from the scheduled hotel at a specific time. Due to the amount of people on the tour and the number of events, no individual rescheduling is allowed. We will be happy to assist you in locating alternate transportation if your schedule does not coincide with the shuttles.</dd>
		<dt>We didn't see any dolphins on our Blue Dolphin tour</dt>
		<dd>Well, dolphins, for the most part, are wild animals. Some tours are brimming over with dolphin goodness, while others (sadly) catch the dolphins on an off day. </dd>
		<dt>Can we swim with the dolphins?</dt>
		<dd>No. Explore California believes that the dolphins, and their habitat should be respected. Out of concerns for the safety of the dolphins and the guests we do not allow close interaction.</dd>
