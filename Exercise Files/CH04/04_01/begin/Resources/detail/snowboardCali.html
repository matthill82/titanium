	<p>California has some of the best snowboarding in the US and at Explore California we've combed the runs to offer you the best resorts in the state. We even offer multi-resort packages for those that just can't get enough of that pack and grind. See you on the slopes! </p>
	
	<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt>Can I bring my own equipment?</dt>
			<dd>Of course! Rentals are provided for anyone who needs them, but you are more than welcome to use your equipment instead.</dd>
			<dt>I tried to register and it said "tour full" why is that?</dt>
			<dd>Certain snowboard tours feature "express lift" tickets which limit the amount of time you spend in line and even offer passes to private slopes. As you can imagine, these tours have a limited amount of tickets available. Book early for best results.</dd>
			<dt>Should I bring any other equipment beside the rental equipment?</dt>
			<dd>While you don't have to, we recommend a good set of goggles and a quality toboggan or hat. Each resort features a full-service pro shop, so anything you leave at home will be available for purchase on the slopes.</dd>
			<dt>Why don't you offer any wilderness trails?</dt>
			<dd>Based on past tours, we find that a controlled environment within a resort setting provides the highest amount of entertainment and safety for our guests. Many of the resorts we tour have wilderness trails available by request, although they are not part of your package.</dd>
