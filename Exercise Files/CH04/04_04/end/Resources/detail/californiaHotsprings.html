	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>How late do the hot springs stay open?</dt>
		<dd>Obviously it differs by resort or area, but most hot springs will close by 11pm. If you want later access, be sure to contact your resort for availability</dd>
		<dt>How hot do the hot springs get?</dt>
		<dd>Not all hot springs are the same, but the ones on our tours average between 100° and 117° F. Seasons do not affect the hot springs, although temperatures have been known to vary slightly throughout the year. Certain health conditions can limit the enjoyment of the springs, or even become dangerous in certain cases. Please let the resort staff know of any medical conditions.</dd>
		<dt>Do hot springs really have medicinal benefits?</dt>
		<dd>It depends on who you ask. The FDA has come out strongly against the majority of claims made by proponents of mineral water treatments. However, studies have shown that inflammation and circulatory problems associated with vascular deficiencies have benefitted from mineral water treatments such as hot springs. Explore California makes no claim as to the medical benefits of hot springs, but we can say from first hand experience that they are relaxing and therapeutic!</dd>
		<dt>What type of minerals are found in hot springs?</dt>
		<dd>Although there are always slight differences, most springs contain calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and sulfur. The sulfur can result in an unpleasant smell if found in high amounts, but is otherwise harmless.</dd>
		<dt>Are the springs chlorinated?</dt>
		<dd>It depends. If you attend a hot springs at a resort, it is very likely that the pool or spring will be chlorinated for guests comfort. In the more natural tours we offer, the pools are just that, natural and pristine.</dd>
