	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>Does Explore California provide bikes?</dt>
		<dd>It depends on the tour. Some of our tours are geared towards biking enthusiasts who are bound to have better bikes than the ones we'd provide. Other, more scenic tours, have a bike rental option that will provide a standard bike for an additional charge. If the tour description does not have that option then no bike rental is available.</dd>
		<dt>Do we have to ride a certain pace?</dt>
		<dd>For the most part, no. Even on the two or three day excursions, Explore California has a chase vehicle that is tasked with ensuring everyone makes the overnight. If there is an area you would like to explore on your own, let the staff know and we can arrange a pickup time for you.</dd>
		<dt>The mountain bike tours mention bringing safety equipment. Like what?</dt>
		<dd>Well, a helmet, of course. Explore California will not allow riders on any course without a helmet. For the more difficult trails, bikers will need kneepads and wrist guards as well. No exceptions.</dd>
		<dt>What happens if my bike breaks during a tour?</dt>
		<dd>Well, if it's your bike than we're very sorry to hear about it. If it is one of our rentals, we will make arrangements to either have the bike fixed, or a replacement bike provided. </dd>
