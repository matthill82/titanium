	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>What does "tour difficulty" in the tour description mean? Is "difficult" really difficult?</dt>
		<dd>OK, fair enough question. Difficulty ratings are obviously in the eye of the beholder. At first we used the Class ranking system that US Parks have used for over 75 years. The problem with that system is that it ranks Classes from Class 1 to Class 5. Only Class 1 and 2 refer to hiking, Class 3 and above are reserved for climbing trails. Since only a small portion of our tours have any climbing (and only optional climbing at that) we devised our own difficulty scale. If you are in good physical shape, you should be able to handle anything our tours throw at you. However, the difficult rating is difficult, and you should read the tour description carefully before committing to the tour. Read our difficulties ratings here for more detail.</dd>
		<dt>Do I get a refund if the trail was too hard for me?</dt>
		<dd>We're sorry, but no. We feel that between the detailed tour description and the difficulty ranking we have set adequate expectations about what level of physical ability is required for each tour. If you feel a tour might be too difficult for you, please feel free to contact one of our agents, or try one of our easier tours to start out.</dd>
		<dt>What can I NOT bring into the camp sites?</dt>
		<dd>For the most part, use common sense. Remember that our camping is in pristine areas of California wilderness, so we have a strict bring-in-in/take-it-out policy. Leaving behind trash or refuse will not be tolerated. Also, drugs and/or weapons are not tolerated in any camping area and will be grounds for immediate cancellation of your tour with no refund. We also ask that you leave your guitars at home. This will prevent any unfortunate "Kumbaya" incidents of having your guitar broken over your head. We appreciate your understanding.</dd>
		<dt>Can I use your backpack?</dt>
		<dd>No, bring your own.</dd>
		<dt>Do you offer self-guided tours?</dt>
		<dd>Most of our tours can be taken as a self-guided tour. We will provide you with a map, camping sites, and the cell phone number of the main group tour guide. Due to the potentially hazardous nature of the Death Valley Trek and MT. Whitney Climb self-guided tours are not allowed.</dd>
		<dt>What do you mean by hazardous?</dt>
		<dd>You could die. We don't want that.</dd>
		<dt>Can you recommend some gear?</dt>
		<dd>Yes we can. Take a look at our tour guides gear recommendations</dd>
